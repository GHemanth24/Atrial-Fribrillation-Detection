**Atrial-Fribrillation-Detection**


## 📌 Overview

This is a Machine Learning + Web Application project built during my training. With proper guidance and self-learning, I developed and customized this project according to what I thought would be more practical and useful from the user’s perspective.

This application is designed to take **medical images and patient data as inputs**, process them using a trained ML/DL model, and display structured outputs via a **web-based interface**. It is fully responsive and can be operated from any device.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django depending on implementation), AJAX
* **Database:** CSV / MySQL (for patient data)
* **ML/DL Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (model training & inference)

---

## ✨ Functionalities

### 1. **Home / Upload Page**

* Allows users to upload medical images for analysis.
* Patient data can also be provided for reference.
* Clean and responsive UI for easy interaction.

### 2. **Image Processing & Prediction**

* Uploaded images are verified and processed by `imageCheck.py`.
* `model.py` runs the trained ML/DL model to generate predictions.
* Dynamic output generation, shown immediately to the user.

### 3. **Results / Output Page**

* Displays processed results in a clean format.
* Shows prediction outcomes alongside patient information.
* Includes visual samples, as seen in screenshots under `Output/`.

### 4. **Training Module**

* `training.ipynb` allows training the ML/DL model with custom datasets.
* Uses `Inputs/Dataset/dataset1.csv` for structured training data.
* Model can be re-trained and updated for improved accuracy.

### 5. **Dashboard (if extended)**

* Registered/logged-in users can manage patient records.
* Track past analyses and view previously uploaded results.
* Dynamic updates whenever images are liked/marked (optional extension).

### 6. **Error Handling & Responsiveness**

* Every exception is handled gracefully with proper UI messages.
* The web application is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone or extract the project.
2. Install dependencies (Python 3.x required):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install libraries used in `model.py` and `training.ipynb`, e.g. TensorFlow/PyTorch, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, etc.)*

## ▶️ Running the Project

1. **Training (optional):**

   * Open `Training/training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   * Run all cells to train the model on `dataset1.csv`.
   * Save the trained model for use in the execution logic.

2. **Execution:**

   * Run the main app:

     ```bash
     python app1_final.py
     ```
   * Open `index.html` in a browser or follow the Flask/Django server link (depending on implementation).
   * Upload sample images from `Inputs/Sample Images for Input/`.
   * View the output as shown in the screenshots under `Output/`.
